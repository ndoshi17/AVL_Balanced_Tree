# AVL_Tree
An implementation of AVL Trees in C including Min Cost Path and Breadth First algorithms. Input file read in by adding each successive element to the tree. 
Breadth First should print:
21
11
31
7
13
23
42
5
9
12
16
22
27
40
73
2
6
8
10
20
25
30
34
41
50
75
0
4
43
61
74

The minimum-cost path should be:
21 11 13 12
